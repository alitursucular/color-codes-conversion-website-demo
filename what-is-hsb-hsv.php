        <p class="text-center">Also Known As: <b>HSB</b> ( <b>h</b>ue, <b>s</b>aturation, <b>b</b>rightness )</p><br>

        <p>Hue, Saturation, Value or <b>HSV</b> is a color model that describes
            <a href="http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/Color.htm" target="_blank">colors</a> (hue or tint) in
            terms of their shade (saturation or amount of gray) and their brightness (<a
                href="http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/Value.htm" target="_blank">value</a> or luminance).</p>

        <p>The HSV color wheel may be depicted as a cone or cylinder. Instead of Value, the color model may use
            Brightness, making it HSB (Photoshop uses HSB).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>H</b>ue is expressed as a number from 0 to 360 degrees representing hues of red (starts at 0), yellow
                (starts at 60), green (starts at 120), cyan (starts at 180), blue (starts at 240), and magenta (starts
                at 300).
            </li>
            <li><b>S</b>aturation is the amount of gray (0% to 100%) in the color.</li>
            <li><b>V</b>alue (or <b>B</b>rightness) works in conjunction with saturation and describes the brightness or
                intensity of the color from 0% to 100%.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>Tech-FAQ: Hue, Saturation and Value explains the color model.<br>
                <i>"The HSV color space is quite similar to the way in which humans perceive color."</i></li>
            <li>Tech-FAQ: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness explains this color model and how it compares to HSV.<br>
                <i>"Because the HSL model keeps the light and saturation aspects of the color model unique from each
                    other,
                    it tends to be more useful for those wishing to take advantage of these attributes in their
                    work."</i>
            </li>
            <li>Intel.com: Color Models describes and shows illustrations for <a
                    href="http://graphicdesign.about.com/od/colorbasics/a/rgb.htm" target="_blank">RGB</a>, CMYK, and
                many other color
                models.
                Just over halfway down the page you'll find a discussion of HLS (aka HSL) and HSV.<br>
                <i>"The HLS (hue, lightness, saturation) and HSV (hue, saturation, value) color models were developed to
                    be
                    more “intuitive” in manipulating with color and were designed to approximate the way humans perceive
                    and
                    interpret color."</i>
            </li>
            <li>Photozone.de: Color Models covers "HSL and HSV – the non-identical twins of color models" and others
                with nice images and detailed explanations.<br>
                <i>"As a method of describing colors, HSV is particularly useful when creating what are called color
                    progressions, meaning, in a restricted sense palettes of related colors having the same or related
                    hues,
                    saturations or values. In this case, knowing the actual figures for the red, green and blue
                    primaries is
                    simply not necessary and HSV offers a more intuitive representation of the relationship between
                    colors.
                    But the thing to be remembered is that HSV is just mapping a particular RGB color space; it is a
                    different coordinate system describing not more and not less than the original RGB space."</i>
            </li>
            <li>Rip's Applied Mathematics: Color: HSB (HSV, HSI) again looks at HSB as it relates to RGB with formulas
                for expressing saturation and intensity.<br>
                <i>"I personally understand HSB by its relationship to RGB. Although hue, H, is the most complicated to
                    describe mathematically, is the one that is obvious to me. All we do is choose an angle; keep it
                    constant, and we’re working with tints, tones, and shades of a fixed color."</i>
