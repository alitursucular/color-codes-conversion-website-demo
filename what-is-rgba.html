                <p>The <strong>RGB color model</strong> is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added
                    together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the
                    initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.
                </p>

                <p>The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in
                    electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional
                    photography. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it,
                    based in human perception of colors.</p>

                <p>RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value
                    differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the
                    individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device
                    over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of
                    color management.</p><br>

                <p><strong>Additive primary colors:</strong></p>

                <p>To form a color with RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be superimposed
                    (for example by emission from a black screen, or by reflection from a white screen). Each of the
                    three beams is called a component of that color, and each of them can have an arbitrary intensity,
                    from fully off to fully on, in the mixture.</p>

                <p>The RGB color model is additive in the sense that the three light beams are added together, and their
                    light spectra add, wavelength for wavelength, to make the final color's spectrum</p>

                <p>Zero intensity for each component gives the darkest color (no light, considered the black), and full
                    intensity of each gives a white; the quality of this white depends on the nature of the primary
                    light sources, but if they are properly balanced, the result is a neutral white matching the
                    system's white point. When the intensities for all the components are the same, the result is a
                    shade of gray, darker or lighter depending on the intensity. When the intensities are different, the
                    result is a colorized hue, more or less saturated depending on the difference of the strongest and
                    weakest of the intensities of the primary colors employed.</p><br>

                <p><strong>Physical principles for the choice of red, green, and blue:</strong></p>

                <p>The choice of primary colors is related to the physiology of the human eye; good primaries are
                    stimuli that maximize the difference between the responses of the cone cells of the human retina to
                    light of different wavelengths, and that thereby make a large color triangle.</p>

                <p>The normal three kinds of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells in the human eye (cone cells) respond
                    most to yellow (long wavelength or L), green (medium or M), and violet (short or S) light (peak
                    wavelengths near 570 nm, 540 nm and 440 nm, respectively). The difference in the signals received
                    from the three kinds allows the brain to differentiate a wide gamut of different colors, while being
                    most sensitive (overall) to yellowish-green light and to differences between hues in the
                    green-to-orange region.</p>

                <p>As an example, suppose that light in the orange range of wavelengths (approximately 577 nm to 597 nm)
                    enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and
                    long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more.
                    The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference is the basis of our
                    perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object
                    entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.</p>

                <p>Use of the three primary colors is not sufficient to reproduce all colors; only colors within the
                    color triangle defined by the chromaticities of the primaries can be reproduced by additive mixing
                    of non-negative amounts of those colors of light.</p><br>
