                <p>Hue, Saturation, Value or <b>HSV</b> is a color model that describes <a
                        href="http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/Color.htm" target="_blank">colors</a> (hue or
                    tint) in terms of their shade (saturation or amount of gray) and their brightness (<a
                        href="http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/Value.htm" target="_blank">value</a> or
                    luminance). Also Known As: <b>HSB</b> ( <b>h</b>ue, <b>s</b>aturation, <b>b</b>rightness )</p>

                <p>The HSV color wheel may be depicted as a cone or cylinder. Instead of Value, the color model may use
                    Brightness, making it HSB (Photoshop uses HSB).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>H</b>ue is expressed as a number from 0 to 360 degrees representing hues of red (starts at
                        0), yellow (starts at 60), green (starts at 120), cyan (starts at 180), blue (starts at 240),
                        and magenta (starts at 300). </li>
                    <li><b>S</b>aturation is the amount of gray (0% to 100%) in the color.</li>
                    <li><b>V</b>alue (or <b>B</b>rightness) works in conjunction with saturation and describes the
                        brightness or intensity of the color from 0% to 100%. </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tech-FAQ: Hue, Saturation and Value explains the color model.<br> <i>"The HSV color space is
                            quite similar to the way in which humans perceive color."</i></li>
                    <li>Tech-FAQ: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness explains this color model and how it compares to
                        HSV.<br> <i>"Because the HSL model keeps the light and saturation aspects of the color model
                            unique from each other, it tends to be more useful for those wishing to take advantage of
                            these attributes in their work."</i> </li>
                    <li>Intel.com: Color Models describes and shows illustrations for <a
                            href="http://graphicdesign.about.com/od/colorbasics/a/rgb.htm" target="_blank">RGB</a>,
                        CMYK, and many other color models. Just over halfway down the page you'll find a discussion of
                        HLS (aka HSL) and HSV.<br> <i>"The HLS (hue, lightness, saturation) and HSV (hue, saturation,
                            value) color models were developed to be more “intuitive” in manipulating with color and
                            were designed to approximate the way humans perceive and interpret color."</i> </li>
                    <li>Photozone.de: Color Models covers "HSL and HSV – the non-identical twins of color models" and
                        others with nice images and detailed explanations.<br> <i>"As a method of describing colors, HSV
                            is particularly useful when creating what are called color progressions, meaning, in a
                            restricted sense palettes of related colors having the same or related hues, saturations or
                            values. In this case, knowing the actual figures for the red, green and blue primaries is
                            simply not necessary and HSV offers a more intuitive representation of the relationship
                            between colors. But the thing to be remembered is that HSV is just mapping a particular RGB
                            color space; it is a different coordinate system describing not more and not less than the
                            original RGB space."</i> </li>
                    <li>Rip's Applied Mathematics: Color: HSB (HSV, HSI) again looks at HSB as it relates to RGB with
                        formulas for expressing saturation and intensity.<br> <i>"I personally understand HSB by its
                            relationship to RGB. Although hue, H, is the most complicated to describe mathematically, is
                            the one that is obvious to me. All we do is choose an angle; keep it constant, and we’re
                            working with tints, tones, and shades of a fixed color."</i> </li>
